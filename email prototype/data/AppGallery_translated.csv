Please follow the steps below: If the system keeps displaying a message indicating that the app is being installed, delete the downloaded app package or terminate the download task and try to install the app again. To delete the app package, open HUAWEI AppGallery, go to Me > Installation packages, and delete the package in question. To terminate the download task, open HUAWEI AppGallery, go to Me > Installation manager, and touch the download progress bar on the right of the app in question. Clear the cache of HUAWEI AppGallery and try to install the app from HUAWEI AppGallery again. (Refer to Step 4 in What should I do if I can't download an app in HUAWEI AppGallery? ) Check whether PrivateSpace has been enabled (by going to Settings > Privacy > PrivateSpace) or whether a sub user has been created (by going to Settings > Users & accounts). If so, disable it and try to install the app in question again. Restart your device, connect it to another network, and try to download and install the app again. The cause of '103 No certificate found' is the app may not be compatible with the device system. The suggestion in the FAQ is 'When you search for the app, check whether there is a tag indicating whether the app is compatible with your device. Download the app after confirming that it is compatible. Also, you can check and update your HMS Core by going to settings> HMS Core> Check for updates.

We hope you’re doing well. This email is regarding your concern about canceling your unknown Subscription. The charges are likely to be related to a Company Subscription you have. If you are being charged for a subscription, it means you have subscribed to it in the past or you have signed up for a free trial that you forgot to deactivate. In our system you appear as the owner of an active Company ID hwid_x4e**********ar connected to your email address xxxxx@xxxx.com. You are most likely being charged for an active subscription you have on that Company ID. Unfortunately, we do not have the necessary permission to cancel subscriptions on behalf of our users, due to privacy concerns. I will provide you with the cancellation steps, but if you run into any issues while following them you will also find below what information we require from you to be able to investigate. Please follow the next guideline to solve your issue: From your Company phone: Settings > Account center > Payment and purchases > Subscriptions and tap the service you wish to cancel the subscription for. From your computer, access the official website: login to https://id7.cloud.Company.com/CAS/portal/login.html and go to Payment and purchases > Subscriptions/Password-free payments and touch Remove. Please note that if you access the website from your phone, you must enable desktop version for the Payment and purchases tab to show up. If the subscription disappears from your account, it indicates that it has been canceled successfully. Once canceled, no deduction will be made from your account from the following month onward. If you need further assistance, please provide us the following information, to investigate your account and provide more information around the subscription: 1. Your Company ID (Phone number include country code/ Email address): 2. Your request: e.g., Cancel Company Cloud subscription/ Cancel Company Music subscription/ Cancel Company video subscription 3. Proof of transactions: a) If the payment was made with your Bank card: Copy of your bank statement showing the charges from *****(PERSON) SE and the last 4 digits of your bank card. b) If the payment was made with your PayPal: A screenshot of payment with transaction invoice number available c) If the payment was made with your Phone: The phone number get charged A screenshot of phone bill showing the charges from *****(PERSON) SE We would greatly appreciate your feedback regarding our email exchange, as we need your input to keep improving our service.
